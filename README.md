We started our code based on an exesting one:  
The HTML and some of the logic.js and dom.js was already written.
##### *  JavaScript  🔩 :
Before we started in the code we wrote some tests using TDD - Test Driven Development - to be sure that our functions is working.         
To run these tests we add Tape to our project by installing it in the terminal   💻.   
 📂 In logic.js file we wrote some functions that adds, deletes and marks new to-dos.  
 📂 In dom.js file we started by adding the HTML tag span and some buttons then we used the TDD functions to build the app and make it working.
